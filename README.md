# sf-housing-prediction
Machine Learning project comparing algorithms for SF housing price prediction
This project implements and compares four different machine learning algorithms to predict housing rental prices in San Francisco:

Linear Regression - Simple linear relationship baseline
Random Forest - Ensemble of decision trees
Gradient Boosting - Sequential learning ensemble
Support Vector Regression - Non-linear kernel method
